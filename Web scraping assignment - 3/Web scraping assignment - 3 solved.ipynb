Rather than that, they turned him into some sort of pussy that is afraid to talk about Hulk. At the Avengers: Endgame, it was nice to see Bruce Banner be one with Hulk, but he lost his savageness which is why Hulk really is a great character. He has a unique character where he is actually really smart and as Hulk, he is really sensible and savage at the same time. They didn't show that version of Hulk, rather they created a new imagination of Hulk. Which is fine in comic-wise but I really didn't like what they created. I would have preffered the Hulk in the comics and animation movies. And the Hulk in the first avengers movie was doing just fine but they screwed him over. What a shame to be honest\",\n",
